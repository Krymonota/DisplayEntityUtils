#The identifier for this controller

#----------------------------------------------------
#Mobs:
#Associate a group with mythic mobs of the specified type(s)
#The group will be associated to the mythic mob when spawned
#
#NOTE: If planning to use this mob handler internally, without MythicMobs,
#simply set "mythicMobs" to []

  #Set the vertical offset that this group should have when attached to an entity

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#Follow Properties:
#Determine how the parts in a group will respect actions of an entity
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  #Entity Follow Types (Controls how the group/model will move in orient itself in respect to the mythic mob):
  #PITCH_AND_YAW -> Follows an entity's head pitch and yaw
  #PITCH -> Follows an entity's head pitch
  #YAW -> Follows an entity's head yaw
  #BODY -> Follows an entity's body yaw
  #NONE -> Following will be disabled
  entityFollowType: PITCH_AND_YAW

  #"deathDespawnDelay" can be set to -1 to disable removal of a group, after an entity's death.
  #The delay is measured in ticks and the value is the same for the default follow properties and part follow properties.
  deathDespawnDelay: 20

  #"teleportDuration" controls how smoothly the group will respect the entity's looking direction
  #The duration is measured in ticks.
  teleportationDuration: 2

  #Determine if interaction entities should pivot while follow an entity's looking direction
  pivotInteractions: false

  #Determine whether certain animation states will enable/disable this follow property

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Animation States:
#Remove the ENTIRE "states" section if creating an animation state machine is NOT desired
#
#Removing unwanted states will not interfere with other animation states
#For example:
#You can remove the "spawn" state and keep the "idle" state, and the idle state will still work as expected
#
#"animationType" determines how the animation will be played.
#"LINEAR" will play the animation one time through
#"LOOP" will play the animation repeatedly, from the beginning
#
#"lockTransition" stops other animations from being played before the
#current one finishes its animation cycle
#
#NOTES:
#- An "animationType" of "LOOP" with a true "lockTransition" may lead to blocking transitions to other states
#
#- The death state will ALWAYS ignore the "lockTransition" value of other states
#
#- If the entity has AI, and it's disabled, the automatic states (Not Mythic nor API created states) will not change the current animation state.

  #Playing Animations with Mythic Mobs Skills:
  #For MythicMobs skills to perform animations, the following mechanic must be added to your skills
  #
  #- deuanimate{id=controller-id;anim=animation-tag;t=animation-type;s=storage-location} @self
  #
  #EXAMPLE: - deuanimate{id=mycontroller;anim=walking_animation;t=LINEAR;s=LOCAL} @self
  #
  #To switch to a different animation state use the following mechanic
  #- deustate{id=controller-id;newState="state-id} @self
  #
  #This mechanic above is useful for changing to machine states created through the api
  #
  #EXAMPLE: - deustate{id=mycontroller;newState=idle} @self
  #
  #To stop an animation add the following mechanic
  #- deustop @self
