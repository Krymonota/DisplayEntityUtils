#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Animation States:
#Remove the ENTIRE "states" section if creating an animation state machine is NOT desired
#
#Removing unwanted states will not interfere with other animation states
#For example:
#You can remove the "spawn" state and keep the "idle" state, and the idle state will still work as expected
#
#"animationType" determines how the animation will be played.
#"LINEAR" will play the animation one time through
#"LOOP" will play the animation repeatedly, from the beginning
#
#"lockTransition" stops other animations from being played before the
#current one finishes its animation cycle
#
#An "animationType" of "LOOP" with a true "lockTransition" may lead to blocking transitions to other states
#
#The death state will ALWAYS ignore the "lockTransition" value of other states
